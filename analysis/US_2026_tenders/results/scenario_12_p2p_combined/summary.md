## Results
- Total shipments: 539,917
- Current mix (S1): $6,072,061.73
- P2P Combined: $6,519,851.42
- Difference: +$447,789.69 (+7.4%)
- Avg per shipment: $12.08 (vs $11.25 current)

## Contract Split

- P2P_US: 258,796 shipments (47.9%), $2,158,573.37
- P2P_US2: 281,081 shipments (52.1%), $4,361,278.05

## Key Findings
1. P2P Combined is **7.4% more expensive** than the current mix -- P2P alone cannot replace the current carrier strategy
2. P2P US wins 47.9% of shipments where it has ZIP coverage, at $8.34 avg vs P2P US2 at $15.52 avg
3. 40 shipments have no P2P coverage at all (0.0% of total)
4. P2P US2 is significantly more expensive than P2P US (avg $15.52 vs $8.34), driving the overall cost higher
5. P2P US alone ($2.97M for 51.8% of shipments) offers excellent value but lacks full coverage
6. P2P Combined becomes competitive when paired with FedEx (see S13, S14, S15)
