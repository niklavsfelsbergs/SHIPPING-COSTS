## 1. Surcharge Discounts in Term 2

**Question:** Do surcharge discounts expire on June 23, 2026?

The agreement states (Pages 8, 18):

> "Term 2: Effective from the start date of Term 2, all Surcharge Modifications in the table(s) above will be assessed as per the published list amounts..."

This appears to mean surcharge discounts (fuel -30%, residential -65%, DAS -65%, etc.) revert to full price after June 22, 2026. Please confirm:

- Do surcharge discounts continue in Term 2?
- If not, can we negotiate to extend them?

Answer:

Travis will clarify
None of the surcharges are being replaced or removed.

## 2. $5M Minimum Revenue Calculation

**Question:** How exactly is the $5M yearly minimum calculated?

The agreement states (Page 9):

> "...calculated quarterly... The first calculation period will be based on the prior three (3) months of Net Revenue beginning 30 days from the Agreement effective date. Prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date, Customer's Net Revenue will be annualized..."

Please confirm:

- Is it a rolling calculation or fixed quarterly periods?
- What specific charges count toward "Net Revenue"?
- When exactly are the quarterly check dates?

Answer:
Also includes surcharges
Only requirement: Have to meet at the end of the year of 5M for the rate cap of 4% to be applicable.

## 3. Earned Discount Tier Calculation

**Question:** How are the Earned Discount tiers calculated?

The agreement states (Page 20):

> "Customer already participates in an Earned Discount calculation. The ongoing calculation will not be impacted by this Agreement."

The methodology is not defined in this document. Please confirm:

- Is it a 52-week rolling average?
- How often are tiers reassessed (weekly/monthly)?
- What charges count toward "Annualized Transportation Charges"?

---

Answer:
52 week rolling average
Keep in mind - we manipulated the tiers, they are reduced by 500k.
Combined gross transportation spend. BEFORE DISCOUNT.
BASED ON THE PUBLISHED RATE. Gross transporation charge. Includes surcharges.
Travis will send me the list price list.

the net rates already include the 18% discount. I can revert it so i can calculate gross spend.

## 4. Volume & Pricing Commitments

**Question:** What happens if we don't meet the volume/pricing commitments?

The agreement lists minimum commitments (Pages 4, 11, 14):

| Service        | Min Avg Daily Volume | Avg Gross Charge/Package |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Express        | 1.40 packages        | $150.69                  |
| Ground/HD      | 963.50 packages      | $25.90                   |
| Ground Economy | 900 packages         | $15.69                   |

The agreement states failure to meet these within 90 days or maintain them can result in pricing changes or termination.

Please confirm:

- How are these measured (daily/weekly/monthly average)?
- What pricing changes would apply if we fall below?
- Is this separate from the $5M minimum revenue requirement?

---

## 5. Rate Cap in Term 2

**Question:** Is there any rate cap protection after June 22, 2026?

The agreement shows (Pages 10, 12, 13):

| Term                           | Rate Cap       |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Term 1 (Jan 12 - Jun 22, 2026) | 4%             |
| Term 2 (Jun 23, 2026+)         | - (none listed)|

Please confirm:

- Is there no rate cap in Term 2?
- Can we negotiate a rate cap for Term 2?
- What is FedEx's typical annual rate increase?

This stays for our contract term of 2 years actually.

---

## 6. Exit Strategy / Termination

**Question:** Can we ever leave the agreement without paying the $500K termination fee?

The agreement states Term 2 **"Does Not Expire"** (Pages 10, 12, 13), and early termination triggers a $500K fee (Pages 9, 18).

Additionally, soliciting bids "more than 120 days prior to the latest end date" triggers the fee - but if there's no end date, this seems impossible.

Please confirm:

- How do we exit this agreement without penalty?
- Is there a notice period for termination after Year 1?
- When can we legally solicit competing bids?
- What are the conditions for a clean exit?

---

## 7. DIM Divisor in Term 2

**Question:** Do the favorable DIM divisors continue after June 22, 2026?

The DIM divisors (250 for Ground, 225 for Economy, 194 for Express) are listed in the Term 1 surcharge modification tables (Pages 17-18). The Term 2 statement says surcharge modifications revert to "published list amounts."

If DIM reverts to published (139 for Ground), this would be a **significant cost increase** for dimensional packages.

Please confirm:

- Does the DIM divisor of 250/225/194 continue in Term 2?
- Or does it revert to the published 139?

Wont be decreased

---

## 8. DIM Divisor Long-Term

**Question:** Are the DIM divisors guaranteed for the duration of our partnership?

Regardless of the Term 2 question above, we need clarity on long-term DIM treatment.

Please confirm:

- Are the DIM divisors (250/225/194) locked in for as long as we're under this agreement?
- Can FedEx change the DIM divisor with notice?
- If so, what notice period applies?

---

## 9. Rate Card Structure & Performance Pricing

**Question:** Does the FedEx Rate Card 2026 show rates after Performance Pricing, but before Earned/Grace discounts?

We need to understand exactly what the rate card represents to correctly apply discounts in our cost calculator.

Our invoices show "Performance Pricing" as a separate negative line item. We need to understand how this relates to the base rate discounts (43%, 46%, etc.) in the agreement.

Please confirm:

- Are the rates in the rate card the "undiscounted" list rates?
- Or are they after Performance Pricing has been applied?
- Is "Performance Pricing" the same as the base rate discounts in our agreement?
- Or is Performance Pricing something different/additional?
- Where in the calculation do Earned and Grace discounts apply?

if ground - performance
express - earned
home - performance

home and ground is both ground services.

## 10. Surcharge List Prices

**Question:** What are the list prices for each surcharge, and where can we find them?

To calculate our discounted surcharge costs, we need the official list prices for each surcharge in our agreement:

Travis will send me 

**Ground Economy Surcharges:**

| Surcharge              | Our Discount | List Price? |

| Fuel Surcharge         | -30%         | ?           |

Please confirm:

- Where is the official source for these list prices? (Service Guide? Rate Card? Online?)
- Are these list prices updated annually with the GRI (General Rate Increase)?
- Do we apply our surcharge discounts to these list prices?

## 11. Fuel Surcharge Rate

**Question:** Where can we find the official fuel surcharge rate, and how is it applied?

The agreement shows fuel discounts (Page 17):

| Service            | Fuel Discount |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Ground US          | -30%          |
| Home Delivery US   | -30%          |
| Ground Economy     | -30%          |
| Express (Domestic) | -25%          |

Please confirm:

- Where is the current fuel surcharge percentage published?
- How often is it updated (weekly/monthly)?
- Is the fuel surcharge applied to (base rate + surcharges) or just the base rate?
- Does our fuel discount (-30%) reduce the fuel surcharge percentage, or the fuel charge amount?

## 12. Weight Basis for Discounts

**Question:** Are discount tiers based on actual weight or billable weight?

The agreement shows different discount percentages by weight tier:

| Weight Tier | Ground/HD Discount |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-10 lbs    | 43%               |
| 11-20 lbs   | 46%               |
| 21-25 lbs   | 50%               |
| 26+ lbs     | 55%               |

Please confirm:

- Is the discount tier determined by **actual weight** or **billable weight** (after DIM calculation)?
- Example: A 5 lb package with DIM weight of 15 lbs - does it get the 43% discount (actual) or 46% discount (billable)?

---

## 13. How Performance Pricing and Earned Discounts Stack

**Question:** How do Performance Pricing and Earned Discounts combine?

Both discounts are applied to the base rate. We need to understand if they are additive or multiplicative.

**Example package:** Zone 5, 10 lbs, List Rate = $20.00, Performance Pricing = 43%, Earned Discount = 16%

**If additive (both calculated on list rate):**
- Performance Pricing: $20.00 × 43% = -$8.60
- Earned Discount: $20.00 × 16% = -$3.20
- Net: $20.00 - $8.60 - $3.20 = **$8.20**

**If multiplicative (earned applied after performance):**
- After Performance: $20.00 × (1 - 0.43) = $11.40
- After Earned: $11.40 × (1 - 0.16) = **$9.58**

Please confirm:

- Are Performance Pricing and Earned Discount both calculated on the list rate (additive)?
- Or is Earned Discount applied to the rate after Performance Pricing (multiplicative)?

Answer:
Sum of the two
Fuel surcharge is calculated after the discounts are applied.

## 14. Demand/Peak Surcharge Periods

**Question:** What are the exact date ranges for demand surcharges in 2026?

The agreement includes demand surcharges (Demand Base, Demand AHS, Demand Oversize) but doesn't specify the dates.

Please confirm:

- What are the exact start and end dates for demand surcharge periods in 2026?
- How much advance notice do we receive before peak periods?
- Are demand surcharges applied in addition to regular surcharges, or do they replace them?

Answer:
Can use 2025 as baseline
End of October
Recent change from peak to demand

---

## 15. General Rate Increase (GRI)

**Question:** When does the annual GRI take effect and how does it interact with our agreement?

Please confirm:

- When does the 2026 GRI take effect? (Typically January?)
- How much advance notice do we receive?
- Does our 4% rate cap (Term 1) apply to the GRI?
- What was the GRI percentage for 2025 and 2026?

---

## 16. Invoice Dispute Window

**Question:** What is the time limit for disputing incorrect charges on invoices?

Please confirm:

- How long do we have to dispute an invoice charge?
- What is the process for submitting a dispute?
- What documentation is required?
