# OnTrac Ground - Cost Structure Summary

OnTrac Ground shipping cost = **Base Rate + Surcharges + Fuel**

---

## Base Rate

The base shipping rate is determined by two factors:
- **Distance (Zone 2-8):** Higher zones mean further delivery, higher cost
- **Billable Weight:** The greater of actual weight or dimensional weight

For large packages (over 1 cubic foot), we pay for the space the package occupies, not just its weight. Rates range from ~$4 for light, nearby packages to ~$60 for heavy, distant ones.

## Surcharges

### Package Size Surcharges (only one applies - the most severe)

| Surcharge | When It Applies | Net Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Over Maximum Limits** | Exceeds 150 lbs, 108", or 165" length+girth | $1,875.00 |
| **Large Package** | Exceeds 72" longest side or ~12 cubic feet | $114.00 |
| **Additional Handling** | Exceeds 50 lbs, 48" longest, 30" second longest, or ~5 cubic feet | $10.80 |

These are penalty charges for packages that require special handling. Larger packages also trigger minimum billable weights (30-150 lbs), increasing the base rate.

### Delivery Location Surcharges (only one applies)

| Surcharge | When It Applies | Net Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Extended Delivery Area** | Remote ZIP codes | $3.52 |
| **Delivery Area** | Semi-rural ZIP codes | $2.64 |

These cover extra miles driven to reach less accessible locations.

### Residential Surcharge

| Surcharge | When It Applies | Net Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Residential** | All shipments (95% are residential) | $0.63 |

Since nearly all deliveries go to homes, this cost is spread across every shipment.

### Peak Season Surcharges (Sept 27 - Jan 16)

| Surcharge | When It Applies | Net Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Demand - Additional Handling** | AHS packages during peak | $11.00 |
| **Demand - Large Package** | Large packages during peak | $52.50 |
| **Demand - Over Maximum Limits** | Oversized packages during peak | $275.00 |
| **Demand - Residential** | All shipments during peak (Oct 25 - Jan 16) | $0.48 |

Peak season surcharges reflect higher carrier costs during the holiday shipping rush.

## Fuel Surcharge

**12.2% of subtotal** (after 35% discount from 18.75% list rate)

Applied last, on top of base rate plus all surcharges. Rate is updated weekly based on fuel prices.
