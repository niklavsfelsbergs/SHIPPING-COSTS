# P2P US - Executive Summary

P2P US Parcel Flex Advantage Plus is a ground shipping service with costs determined by distance (zone), package size, and weight. There is no fuel surcharge.

## Cost Components

### Base Rate ($3.56 - $20.48)
The shipping rate depends on:
- **Zone (1-8):** Distance from Chicago origin. Higher zone = farther destination = higher cost.
- **Billable weight:** The greater of actual weight or dimensional weight (volume / 250). Unlike other carriers, dimensional weight is always considered regardless of package size.

### Additional Handling Surcharge - $29.00
Applies to packages that are difficult to handle due to size or weight:
- Longest side exceeds 48 inches
- Second-longest side exceeds 30 inches
- Length plus girth exceeds 105 inches
- Billable weight exceeds 30 lbs

When triggered by dimensional conditions, the minimum billable weight is set to 30 lbs for rate calculation.

### Oversize Surcharge - $125.00
Applies to very large packages where billable weight exceeds 70 lbs. Since the service limit is 50 lbs actual weight, this only applies to extremely voluminous packages (over 17,500 cubic inches).

## Surcharge Stacking

Both surcharges can apply to the same package. A large, heavy package could incur both Additional Handling and Oversize charges, totaling $154.00 in surcharges.

## Example Cost

A 50" x 25" x 10" package (8 lbs actual) shipped to Los Angeles:
- Base rate: $20.48 (50 lbs dimensional weight, zone 8)
- Additional Handling: $29.00 (longest side exceeds 48")
- **Total: $49.48**
